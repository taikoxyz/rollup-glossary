## Why privacy?
Let’s start by unpacking a foundational question: what is privacy? Often, we associate privacy with the act of concealment—like enclosing a letter in an envelope to shield its content from unauthorized eyes, or donning a mask at a masquerade to preserve anonymity. In a world where light rays bounce around everywhere, acts of concealment like these are integral to maintaining privacy. But we do not live solely in the physical world anymore - we live simultaneously in the digital one, and privacy in the digital sphere is of rather a different sort. When we speak of digital privacy, we are usually not talking about protecting our circuits from light rays, but rather programming them to reveal precisely the information we want to reveal. Privacy as we mean it is not about hiding, but about revealing.
Privacy is the freedom to reveal, and this freedom is for everyone. Free expression without the fear of retribution requires the freedom to reveal different opinions to different people at different times. Free assembly without the fear of repression requires the freedom to coordinate in private and demonstrate in public. A functioning state needs the freedom to reveal policies and actions, and the freedom not to reveal all the details of its internal operations. Self-protection by minorities and disenfranchised groups requires the freedom not to reveal aspects of their identities and lifestyles which might meet with rejection by mainstream society, and participation in society requires the freedom to reveal aspects which they do want to share. Falling in love with someone involves, in part, gradually revealing yourselves to one another.
Public blockchains do not provide this freedom to reveal. When you use Bitcoin or Ethereum, you must choose between sending a transparent transaction that reveals everything about your interaction to everyone in the world, or not interacting with the system at all. Your choice is binary - interact and reveal all, or opt-out and reveal nothing - there are no options in between. If our industry aims to offer a viable alternative to financial, economic, and communication infrastructure which relies on trusted third parties, privacy is not an optional feature - privacy is table stakes.

## Bytecode-equivalent ZK-EVM

A [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#zk-rollup) that can interpret and execute [EVM](/other-terms#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)) [bytecode](/other-terms#bytecode). All EVM opcodes and pre-compiles are supported and provable through the [ZK-EVM](/other-terms#zk-evm) [circuit](/other-terms#circuit), but gas costs for EVM opcodes might be changed. (Type 2.5 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Data availability

The property of a [rollup](#rollup)’s state being reachable by any [node](/other-terms#node) retrieving the inputs that were rolled up and executed to reach said state. Data availability (DA), specifically decoupling it from the rollup nodes themselves, is one of the preeminent factors which allows a rollup to [scale](#Scalability) securely. A rollup is faced with a decision of what to use as a DA layer to guarantee that any node can retrieve this data--permissionlessly under any circumstance. For this reason, using Ethereum for DA currently provides the strongest security guarantees. If data is stored somewhere other than a permissionless [L1](/other-terms#Layer-1), then the [L2](#Layer-2) is not a rollup, but some other type of L2.

## Decentralized rollup

There are several factors within a [rollup](#rollup) construction which separately can be more or less decentralized, leading to the degree to which the rollup as a whole is uncapturable by a central entity. The most significant factors include who can run a [node](/other-terms#node), who can [propose](#proposer) [blocks](/other-terms#block), who can [prove](#prover) blocks (in [ZK-Rollups](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup)), and who can [upgrade](#Upgradeability) the rollup [smart contracts](/other-terms#Smart-contract). For the factors of "who can run a node/proposer/prover", the question asks both: is it [permissionless](#permissionless) for anyone to run these (no allow-list); and how reasonable is it in terms of hardware required.

## Ethereum-equivalent ZK-EVM

A [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup) that can [prove](/other-terms#Prover) the correctness of an actual Ethereum [L1](/other-terms#Layer-1) [block](/other-terms#Block) in its [ZK-EVM](#ZK-EVM) [circuit](/other-terms#circuit). No changes made to any part of Ethereum--EVM but also peripheral things like storage structures and hash functions. (Type 1 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## EVM-equivalent ZK-EVM

A [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup) that can interpret and execute [EVM](/other-terms#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)) [bytecode](/other-terms#Bytecode). All EVM opcodes and [pre-compiles](/other-terms#Pre-compiles) are supported and provable through the [ZK-EVM])(#ZK-EVM) [circuit](/other-terms#circuit). (Type 2 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Bytecode-compatible (EVM-compatible) ZK-EVM

A [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup) that can interpret and execute Ethereum [bytecode](/other-terms#Bytecode), with some changes made to certain components of the [EVM](/other-terms#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)), such as different gas costs, or some unsupported features. (Type 2.5 and 3 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Finality

> Needs help: some people distinguish order vs execution finality.

Finality is a scale--when a valid [L2](#Layer-2) [transaction](/other-terms#Transaction) is included in an [L1](/other-terms#Layer-1) [block](/other-terms#Block), it has the same finality as that enclosing block. This is different from correctness, because incorrect state transitions can still have a concept of finality in an enclosing L1 block but be later proven as invalid.

## Language-compatible ZK-EVM

A [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup) that can interpret and execute Solidity or other high-level-language source code. This code is compiled into [bytecode](/other-terms#Bytecode) that differs from that which the [EVM](/other-terms#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)) runs. (Type 4 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Layer 2

Layer 2 (L2) is a category of technical solutions which build upon an [L1](/other-terms#layer-1) with the aim of improving [scalability](#scalability), privacy, or other properties. L2s make use of L1 to bootstrap security and [settlement](/other-terms#settlement) guarantees. The L2 and L1 de-composition represents an example of a [modular blockchain](/other-terms#Modular-blockchains) framework.

## Permissionless

Anyone willing should be able to join and leave the [network](/other-terms#Network) at any time, without causing significant disturbance to the network or being detrimental to the party in question. No single entity should have the power to allowlist or blocklist participants.

## Rollup

A rollup is a chain, specifically a chain which is derived from a base chain's state (the base chain in this context can be referred to as a data availability layer). A rollup does not need a proving system, because it is defined by the state of the base chain and how it is derived. A proving system does not define a rollup, but it's a mechanism for one chain to develop some confidence to trust the data from some other chain. A rollup is another chain, and multiple rollups means higher bandwidth, similar to lanes of traffic on the highway, which offers cheaper fees. Also, it might omit taking part in consensus, which reduces costs as well (and relying on the consensus of the base chain).

## Scalability

The ability of a blockchain to handle a high level of throughput as measured in transactions per second (TPS), holding [decentralization](#decentralized-rollup) and hardware requirements constant.

## Trustless

The ability of a [network](/other-terms#Network) to mediate [transactions](/other-terms#Transaction) without any of the involved parties needing to trust a third party. A further definition may be: given a starting set of trust assumptions or point of understanding, the inability for this understanding to be unilaterally changed by any one party.

## Upgradeability

The ability for [rollup smart contracts](/other-terms#rollup-contracts) and parameters used in a rollup to be updated by holders of an admin key. Upgradeability represents a vector of risk for users, and should be decentralized and combined with [time delays](/other-terms#time-delay) for greater security guarantees.

## ZK-EVM

A ZK-EVM is understood as either:
- A set of [circuits](/other-terms#circuit) that prove the execution of the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](/other-terms#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)). It is the core component of a [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup) that generates [validity proofs](/other-terms#Validity-proof) to verify the correctness of programs.
- The [ZK-Rollup](/other-terms#ZK-Rollup) as a whole which offers [EVM-compatible](#Bytecode-compatible-(EVM-compatible)-ZK-EVM) execution, and proves that execution with [circuits](/other-terms#circuit) that generate [validity proofs](/other-terms#Validity-proof).
