# What is this?

An effort in rollup education, with the ultimate goal to provide users with the tools (or terminology) necessary to understand differences, risks, and make informed decisions. 

There are two glossaries:
- [Foundational terms](/foundational-terms)
- [Rollup glossary](/rollup-glossary)

We separate them, for now, because we want to focus on the foundational (at times contentious) terms first and come to a good community consensus in order to properly educate rollup users. It would be great if rollup projects contributed to this and then adopted a consistent set of language for critical terms.

This is meant to be for rollups at large; it's not tied to any specific rollup project or implementation. That said, if there is ambiguity in a definition, it can be assumed that the concept pertains to rollups built atop Ethereum. Further, some concepts apply to Ethereum/L1 as well as rollups/L2; the glossary tries not to define the concept in relation to Ethereum/L1. For Ethereum definitions, check out the [Ethereum glossary](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/).

For a comprehensive framework to understand different rollups and their associated risks, check out [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk). Perhaps this glossary ends up folding into L2Beat's much more comprehensive set of material.
