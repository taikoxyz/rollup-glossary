# What is this?

An effort in rollup education, with the ultimate goal to provide users with the tools necessary to understand differences, risks, and make informed decisions.

There are two glossaries:
- [Foundational terms](/foundational-terms)
- [Rollup glossary](/rollup-glossary)

We separate them, for now, because we want to focus on the foundational (at times contentious) terms first and come to a good community consensus in order to properly educate rollup users.

See [How to contribute](/how-to-contribute) for more information.
