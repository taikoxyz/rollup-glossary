# What is this?

There are two glossaries:
- [Contentious terms](/contentious-terms)
- [Rollup glossary](/rollup-glossary)

We separate them, for now, because we want to focus on the contentious terms first and come to a good community consensus in order to properly educate rollup users.

See [How to contribute](/how-to-contribute) for more information.
