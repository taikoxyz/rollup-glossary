# How to contribute

Every page on this site including this one is editable. You can edit it by clicking on the "Edit this page" link at the right side of every page or the GitHub icon at the top of each page.

After creating an edit, you can submit a pull request. We are maintaining this currently at Taiko, but the intent of this is to move it on to a neutral third party like L2Beat or the official Ethereum-org website. Or, a new repo with rules for upgrading it such as needing an approval from 3 different rollup projects, etc. It is only intended to be a **public good** and we strongly encourage participation from other L2 teams and the community so we can have proper agreement on the terms.

There is a 500 character limit. And it should be alphanumerical. A definition should be of this format:

```
## <name>
<description capped at 500 characters>
```
