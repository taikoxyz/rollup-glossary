## Bytecode-equivalent ZK-EVM

A [ZK-Rollup](/rollup-glossary#zk-rollup) that can interpret and execute [EVM](/rollup-glossary#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)) [bytecode](/rollup-glossary#bytecode). All EVM opcodes and pre-compiles are supported and provable through the [ZK-EVM](/rollup-glossary#zk-evm) [circuit](/rollup-glossary#circuit), but gas costs for EVM opcodes are changed. (Type 2.5 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Decentralized rollup

There are several factors within a [rollup](/rollup-glossary#rollup) construction which separately can be more or less decentralized, leading to the degree to which the rollup as a whole is uncapturable by a central entity. The most significant factors include who can run a node, who can [propose](#proposer) blocks, who can [prove](#prover) blocks (in ZK-Rollups), and who can [upgrade](#Upgradeability) the rollup smart contracts. For the factors of "who can run a node/proposer/prover", the question asks both: is it [permissionless](#permissionless) for anyone to run these (no allow-list); and how reasonable is it in terms of hardware required.

## Ethereum-equivalent ZK-EVM

A ZK-Rollup that can prove the correctness of an actual Ethereum L1 block in its ZK-EVM circuit. No changes made to any part of Ethereum--EVM and beyond. (Type 1 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## EVM-equivalent ZK-EVM

A ZK-Rollup that can interpret and execute EVM bytecode. All EVM opcodes and pre-compiles are supported and provable through the ZK-EVM circuit. (Type 2 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Bytecode-compatible (EVM-compatible) ZK-EVM

A ZK-Rollup that can interpret and execute Ethereum bytecode, with some changes made to certain components of the EVM, such as different gas costs, or some unsupported features. (Type 2.5 and 3 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Finality

The guarantee that a set of [transactions](/rollup-glossary#transaction) before a given time will not change and can't be reverted. When finality is reached differs meaningfully between ZK (validity) and optimistic rollups, and at times within those categories as well.

## Language-compatible ZK-EVM

A ZK-Rollup that can interpret and execute Solidity or other high-level-language source code. This code is compiled into bytecode that differs from that which the EVM runs. (Type 4 in [Vitalik's classification](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)).

## Layer 2

Layer 2 (L2) is a category of technical solutions which build upon an [L1](/rollup-glossary#layer-1) with the aim of improving [scalability](#scalability), privacy, or other properties. L2s make use of L1 to bootstrap security and [settlement](/rollup-glossary#settlement) guarantees. The L2 and L1 de-composition represents an example of a modular blockchain framework.

## Permissionless

Anyone willing should be able to join and leave the network at any time, without causing significant disturbance to the network or being detrimental to the party in question. No single entity should have the power to allowlist or blocklist participants.

## Rollup

A type of layer 2 scaling solution that batches multiple transactions and submits them to a separate chain (like an L1) in a single transaction. The validity of the batch is proven either up front with a validity proof (ZK-Rollup), or after some challenge period has elapsed without a fraud proof being submitted (Optimistic Rollup). Rollups allow for reductions in gas costs and increases in transaction throughput while inheriting security guarantees from the L1/DA chain to which they posted the transaction data.

## Scalability

The ability of a blockchain to handle a high level of throughput as measured in transactions per second (TPS), holding [decentralization](#decentralized-rollup) and hardware requirements constant.

## Trustless

The ability of a network to mediate transactions without any of the involved parties needing to trust a third party. A further definition may be: given a starting set of trust assumptions or point of understanding, the inability for this understanding to be unilaterally changed by any one party.

## Upgradeability

The ability for smart contracts and parameters used in a rollup to be updated by holders of an admin key. Upgradeability represents a vector of risk for users, and should be decentralized and combined with time delays for greater security guarantees.
